# Projects-in-C

This project is about Simon's game in which the sequence of colors is displayed to the player and he needs to input the colors in the same order in which it was displayed.
If he inserts the sequence correctly the length of the sequence increases and if he loses, the game restarts.

Here I have used DAQlib.h and windows.h libraries to run the game.
